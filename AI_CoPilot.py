Certainly! Since we don't have the specific code, I'll give you an example of how you could refactor and optimize a simple function that finds all prime numbers up to a given limit:

```python
import math

def find_primes(limit):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, limit+1):
        is_prime = True
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):
            if num % i == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

Here's a refactored version of the function that incorporates some of the optimization strategies mentioned earlier:

```python
import math

def find_primes(limit):
    primes = [2]  # Start with 2 as the first prime number
    for num in range(3, limit+1, 2):  # Only check odd numbers, since even numbers (except for 2) are not prime
        is_prime = True
        sqrt_limit = int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1
        for prime in primes:
            if prime > sqrt_limit:
                break
            if num % prime == 0:
                is_prime = False
                break
        if is_prime:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes
```

In this refactored version:

1. Instead of starting the loop from 2 and checking all numbers up to the limit, we start from 3 and only check odd numbers (except for 2 as the first prime number). This reduces the number of iterations by half.
2. We calculate the square root of the current number (limit) only once and store it in a variable (`sqrt_limit`), instead of recalculating it within each iteration of the inner loop.
3. We introduce an early exit strategy by checking if a prime number is greater than `sqrt_limit`. If true, we can conclude that no further prime factorization is possible and break out of the inner loop.
4. We store the prime numbers found in a list (`primes`) to avoid redundant calculations and improve subsequent iterations.

Note that this is just one example, and the actual optimizations will depend on the specific code you are working with.
