The code provided seems to be already optimized. However, here are a few suggestions for improving readability and maintainability:

1. Use meaningful variable names: Instead of using generic names like `item`, `result`, or `url`, try to use more descriptive names that convey the purpose or content of the variable.

2. Separate concerns: It is generally a good practice to separate different functionalities into separate functions or classes. For example, you can separate the code related to web scraping and content extraction into its own class or functions.

3. Use comments to explain complex logic or intentions: If there are any specific sections of code that are non-obvious, consider adding comments to explain the purpose or logic behind it.

4. Error handling: It might be beneficial to add error handling for any potential exceptions that could occur during API calls or network operations.

5. Code formatting: Make sure to follow a consistent code formatting style throughout the code to improve readability. PEP 8 is a widely accepted style guide for Python code.

Remember to thoroughly test any changes you make to ensure the code continues to function as expected.
