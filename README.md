# Autonomous Content Aggregator

Autonomous Content Aggregator is a Python-based project that allows users to effortlessly curate and publish high-quality content from the web. This project operates entirely autonomously, using search queries and web extraction techniques to fetch, curate, and publish content without the need for manual intervention.

## Key Features

1. **Content Search**: The program allows users to define search queries and uses the Requests library to fetch search results from popular search engines programmatically. It analyzes the search results to identify relevant URLs for content extraction.

2. **Web Content Extraction**: Using tools like BeautifulSoup or HuggingFace's small models, the project extracts relevant information from the fetched URLs. It can extract text, images, or other media elements based on specific user requirements. The extraction process analyzes the HTML structure of the web pages to fetch targeted content accurately.

3. **Content Curation**: The extracted content is automatically curated and organized based on user-defined preferences and filters. The program can filter content based on keywords, categories, sentiment, or other criteria specified by the user. It then categorizes and organizes the content for further processing.

4. **Natural Language Processing**: The project leverages HuggingFace's small models to perform natural language processing tasks on the extracted text. It can generate summaries, extract key information, or perform sentiment analysis on the content. These NLP capabilities enable the program to generate meaningful insights from the curated content.

5. **Multi-Platform Publishing**: The program integrates with popular content management systems and social media platforms to publish the curated content automatically. It can use APIs or library integrations to publish content on platforms like WordPress, Medium, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This feature helps users reach a wider audience by automating the content publishing process.

6. **Dynamic Content Updates**: The Autonomous Content Aggregator continuously monitors the web for new and updated content related to the user's defined search queries. It automatically fetches and updates the curated content to ensure freshness and relevance. This feature allows users to keep their content up to date and engage the audience with the latest information.

## Benefits

1. **Autonomy**: The project operates entirely autonomously, eliminating the need for manual intervention in content search, extraction, curation, and publishing processes. This saves time and effort for the user.

2. **Dynamic Content**: By monitoring the web for updates, the Autonomous Content Aggregator ensures that the curated content remains fresh and up to date. This helps users provide valuable and relevant information to their audience.

3. **Scalability**: The project can handle large volumes of content and search queries, making it suitable for users with diverse content requirements. It can easily scale to accommodate increased demand without compromising performance.

4. **Flexibility**: The program allows users to define their preferences and filters for content extraction and curation. It can be customized to align with specific content requirements, target audience, and publishing platforms.

5. **Resource Efficiency**: By leveraging online resources and tools, the project minimizes the need for local files and manual data storage. This makes it resource-efficient and reduces the dependency on the user's PC storage.

SOCIAL_MEDIA_API_KEYS = {
    "twitter": {
        "consumer_key": "YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY",
        "consumer_secret": "YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET",
        "access_token": "YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "access_token_secret": "YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
    },
    "medium": {
        "bearer_token": "YOUR_MEDIUM_BEARER_TOKEN"
    },
    "linkedin": {
        "access_token": "YOUR_LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }
}
```

5. Start using the Autonomous Content Aggregator:

```python
from autonomous_content_aggregator import ContentAggregator, WebContentExtractor, ContentCuration, NLPProcessor, ContentPublisher

search_engine_api_key = "YOUR_SEARCH_ENGINE_API_KEY"
content_aggregator = ContentAggregator(search_engine_api_key)

query = "python programming"
relevant_urls = content_aggregator.search_content(query)

web_content_extractor = WebContentExtractor()
extracted_text = []
extracted_images = []

for url in relevant_urls:
    response = requests.get(url)
    html = response.content

    text = web_content_extractor.extract_text(html)
    images = web_content_extractor.extract_images(html)

    extracted_text.append(text)
    extracted_images.extend(images)

preferences = {
    "keywords": ["tutorial", "tips"],
    "categories": ["programming"],
    "sentiment": "positive"
}

content_curation = ContentCuration(preferences)
filtered_content = content_curation.filter_content(extracted_text)
organized_content = content_curation.organize_content(filtered_content)

nlp_processor = NLPProcessor()
sentiments = [nlp_processor.analyze_sentiment(content) for content in organized_content]
summaries = [nlp_processor.generate_summary(content) for content in organized_content]

social_media_api_keys = {
    "twitter": {
        "consumer_key": "YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY",
        "consumer_secret": "YOUR_TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET",
        "access_token": "YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        "access_token_secret": "YOUR_TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET"
    },
    "medium": {
        "bearer_token": "YOUR_MEDIUM_BEARER_TOKEN"
    },
    "linkedin": {
        "access_token": "YOUR_LINKEDIN_ACCESS_TOKEN"
    }
}

content_publisher = ContentPublisher(social_media_api_keys)

for i in range(len(organized_content)):
    tweet = f"{summaries[i]} #pythonprogramming"
    content_publisher.publish_tweet(tweet)

    article = {
        "title": f"Python Programming Tutorial - Part {i+1}",
        "content": organized_content[i],
        "tags": ["Python", "Programming"]
    }
    content_publisher.publish_medium_article(article)

    post = {
        "content": f"Check out this Python programming {summaries[i]}",
        "image_url": extracted_images[i]
    }
    content_publisher.publish_linkedin_post(post)
```

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders in the code with your API keys and make any necessary adjustments according to your requirements.
